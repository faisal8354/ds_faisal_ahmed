## 🔍 Overview
In this project, I analyzed how trader behavior — including average position sizes, closed PnL, and overall trading volume — aligns with Bitcoin market sentiment, using a Fear & Greed index merged with historical trader data.

The analysis covers:
- Average position size during Fear vs Greed periods
- Average closed PnL across sentiment regimes
- Total trading volume in USD by sentiment

I found that traders generally take larger positions and trade more heavily during periods of Greed, with PnL roughly stable but slightly favoring optimistic phases.
