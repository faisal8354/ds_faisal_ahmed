### How to Run
- Open `notebook_1.ipynb` in Google Colab.
- Follow the cells to see data loading, cleaning, merging, analysis, and plots.

### Insights

- Closed PnL is relatively stable but shows slight favor toward Greed periods.
- Detailed analysis is in the notebook and summarized in `ds_report.pdf`.
